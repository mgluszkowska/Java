### My first Java project for university

###### What I used: Java, Quartz

It's an interactive console program written in Java. It creates lists of citizens and stores them in text files. The program waits for the user to enter a name of a city, a person's name, surname and a PESEL number. Then it checks if the number is correct and in case it isn't, the entry isn't accepted and an error message is displayed. Every 30 seconds the program saves the data to a text file, organized alphabetically. The scheduling is made with a framework called Quartz and cron expressions.
